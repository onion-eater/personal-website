# Personal Website

This is my personal website.

Made using:
- Vite + React + Typescript
- Three.js for 3D Model thingy
- Last.fm API for music thingy
- Vercel for hosting

TO-DO:
- make the last played song component ui prettier (i.e. make it look sorta like spotify with icon)
  - perhaps playback through website?
  - ^ if implemented maybe an audio visualizer as well
- create project component
- create blog page + component?
- do something about no gpu acceleration
- dilly dally
- discover something that doesnt exist/give a monkey a shower
